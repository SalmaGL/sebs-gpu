To compile the code just set the NETCDFDIR and CompArch. You can change other variables as you wish.

Make sure that the NetCDF is compiled with the same compiler as nvcc is going to use as C compiler.

Once you have set the parameter accordingly, you can just type 

make 

and everything should be compiled.

Remember the main SEBS functions are:

- constants.h
- SEBS_EnergyBalance.{cu,cuh}
- SEBS_Daily_Evapotranspiration.{cu,cuh}
- SEBS_kb_1.{cu,cuh}

The other functiosn are just there to show how to use these three functions in your own code.
