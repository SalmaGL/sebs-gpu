To compile the code just set the NETCDFDIR and CC. You can change other variables as you wish.

Make sure that the NetCDF is compiled with the same C compiler.

Once you have set the parameter accordingly, you can just type 

make 

and everything should be compiled.

Remember the main SEBS functions are:

- constants.h
- SEBS_EnergyBalance.{c,h}
- SEBS_Daily_Evapotranspiration.{c,h}
- SEBS_kb_1.{c,h}
- SEBS_kb_1_yang_bulktransfercoefficients.{c,h}
- SEBS_kb_1_yang.{c,h}
- SEBS_kb_1_yang_MOlength.{c,h}

The other functiosn are just there to show how to use these three functions in your own code.
